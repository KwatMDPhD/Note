## Abstract

Less is more.

Optimize for mastery, which requires being able to change fast, which requires being lean.

If this were easy, what would it look like?

Doing difficult things starts with an initial resistance (for example, beginning of an exercise is uncomfortable), and being aware of this phenomenon and overcoming it on demand is required for achieving greatness.

Every adversity, carries with it, the seed of equivalent advantage.

Become the best in the world first; everything else follows.

Riches live in the niches.

You must become a disaster before a master.
