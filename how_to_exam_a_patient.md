## Circulatory

### Radial Artery

(Systolic blood pressure of 80 is required.)

Measure heart rate and check if the rhythm is regular.

### Jagular Vein

Have the patient angle at 45 degrees and turn the head to the left, and measure the distance from the sternal angle to a pulsation.
(It should be less than 5cm.)

### Carotid Artery

(Systolic blood pressure of 60 is required.)

One side at a time, palpate.

One side at a time, have the patient take a deep breath and hold, and bell auscultate.

### Heart

Feel the apex.
(It is palpable in 25% of adults.)

Diaphram auscultate LLSB, LICS2, the apex, and RICS2.

Bell auscultate the apex.

In the left lateral position, bell auscultate the apex.
(Hear for S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.)

Have the patinet sit forward and exhale a deep breath, diaphram auscultate LLSB.
(Hear for aortic regurgitation.)

### Peripheral Artery

Check pulse from:

- Brachial artery
- Popliteal artery
- Distal tibial artery
- Dorsalis pedis artery

### Lower Extremity

Press distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for indention.

## Pulmonary

### Chest

Inspect:

- Distress
- Asymmetry
- Deformity

### Neck

Palpate trachea.

### Lung

Diaphram auscultate:

- Anterior 2 levels
- Lateral 2 levels
- Posterior 3 levels

Percuss:

- Posterior 3 levels

(When percussing, any fluid inside or outside the airway results in dullness.)

(When auscultating, any fluid inside the airway results in more resonance but any fluid outside the airway results in less resonance.)

(The 2nd level should be at the triangle made of trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and scapula.)

### Abdominal

### Abdomen

Inspect:

- Contour
- Mass
- Vein
- Movement

Diaphram auscultate the center.

Percuss all areas.

All areas but starting furthest from any pain, palpate superficially and then deeply.

Press slowly and then release quickly.

### Liver

Percuss and size.
(The height should be less than 12cm.)

While the patient exhales a deep breath, palpate.

### Spleen

Have the patient continuously take deep breaths, and percuss and size.
(The height should be less than 7cm.)

Have the patient exhale a deep breath, and sandwitch palpate.

### Abdominal Aorta

Palpate and size.
(The diameter should be less than 3cm.)

### Kidney

Press costovertebral angle.

Sandwitch palpate.

## Neural
