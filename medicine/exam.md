Look for distress.

Measure the body temperature.

Measure the heart rate.

Measure the blood pressure.

Measure the respiratory rate.

Measure the oxygen %.

Palpate the skull.

Check the nose for congestion.

Scope the nose.

Palpate the structures around the eyes.

Palpate the sinuses.

Palpate the ears.

Scope the ears.

Palpate inside the mouth.

Place a tongue blade on the side to avoid triggering the gag reflex, and inspect inside the mouth.

Palpate the neck lymph nodes.

Palpate the larynx.

Palpate the thyroid gland.

Touch the radial arteries to measure the heart rate and rhythm.
(This requires a systolic blood pressure of 80 mMHg.)

Have the patient sit at a 45-degree angle, turn their head to the left, and measure the distance on the right jugular vein from the sternal angle to the pulse.
(It should be less than 5cM.)

One side at a time, palpate the carotid arteries.

One side at a time, have the patient take a deep breath and hold, and bell auscultate.
(This requires a systolic blood pressure of 60 mMHg.)

Feel the heart apex.
(It is palpable in 25% of adults.)

Diaphragm auscultate the LLSB, the LICS2, the heart apex, and the RICS2.

Bell auscultate the heart apex.

Have the patient lie on their left side and bell auscultate the heart apex.
(Listen for an S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.)

Have the patient sit forward and exhale a deep breath, and diaphragm auscultate the LLSB.
(Listen for aortic regurgitation.)

Check the brachial arteries for pulses.

Check the popliteal arteries for pulses.

Check the distal tibial arteries for pulses.

Check the dorsalis pedis arteries for pulses.

Press the distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for an indentation.

Inspect the chest for distress, asymmetries, and deformities.

Palpate the trachea.

Diaphragm auscultate the lungs at 2 anterior levels, 2 lateral levels, and 3 posterior levels.
(Fluids inside the airways result in more resonance and those outside less.)
(The 2nd level is within the triangle formed by the trapezius, the latissimus dorsi, and the scapula.)

Percuss the lungs at 3 posterior levels.
(Fluids inside or outside the airways result in dullness.)

Inspect the abdominal contours.

Inspect the abdomen for masses, veins, and movements.

Diaphragm auscultate the abdominal center.

Percuss all abdominal areas.

Starting furthest from any pain, palpate the abdomen superficially and then deeply.

Press the abdomen slowly and deeply, hold, and release quickly.

Percuss the liver to size it.
(Its height should be less than 12cM.)

Have the patient exhale deeply, and palpate the liver.

Have the patient take deep breaths continuously, and percuss the spleen to size it.
(Its height should be less than 7cM.)

Have the patient exhale deeply, and sandwich-palpate the spleen.

Palpate the abdominal aorta and size it.
(Its diameter should be less than 3cM.)

Press the kidneys at the costovertebral angles, the spaces on the back between the 12th rib and the vertebral column.

Sandwich-palpate the kidneys.
